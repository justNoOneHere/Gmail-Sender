# Gmail Sender

This is a script for sending emails using Gmail. It allows the user to input their email and password, the email subject and message, an optional attachment, and a list of recipient email addresses. When the "Send Emails" button is clicked, the email is sent to all the specified recipients using Gmail's SMTP server.

## Getting Started

To use this form, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Fill out the email form with the required information and click the "Send Emails" button to send the email.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following files:

```index.html```: the HTML form.

```style.css```: the CSS styling for the form.

```email-sender.js```: the JavaScript code for sending the email using Gmail's SMTP server.
